[ImprovedLightingShaders]
# iMaxLightCount (minimum 4, maximum 10, default 8)
#  Maximum number of lights per terrain-cell (requires modified shaders to make use of any increased light count)
#  Unpatched game only uses 4 lights, but the engine itself seems to support up to ~10 lights.
#  Using 10 lights has some caveats though, 8 lights is currently the safest option.
#  If you're using more than 8 lights and you notice terrain issues, try enabling bIncreaseLightBuffers.
#  (Enabling bIncreaseLightBuffers below allows this to go up to 13 lights, and should make using above 8 lights more stable)
iMaxLightCount = 12

# bPrioritisePipLight (default 1)
#  Whether or not the Pip-Boy light will be prioritised over other lights in the same terrain-cell.
#  This is the same effect that "Pip-Boy Light Priority Fix Plugin" had.
#  When using an increased iMaxLightCount this probably isn't needed, but in certain cases it might still help.
bPrioritisePipLight = 1

# bIncreaseLightBuffers (default 0)
#  If enabled, will patch the game to use larger buffers for storing light-data.
#  This allows using iMaxLightCount above 10 (up to 13), and should make using above 8 lights more stable (eg. fixes mid-range terrain disappearing)
#  Note that enabling this will apply 100+ patches to the game, in order to redirect every reference to the light buffers.
#  In my own testing it seems stable enough, but other peoples setups could run into something unexpected.
#  If you do try this out and notice anything strange please let me know about it, I'm happy to try fixing this up.
