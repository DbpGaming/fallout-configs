; This option enables Runtime Editor IDs functionality that lets you use editor IDs from GECK in the game.
; It is required if a mod uses GetEditorID function. Set it to 1 if a mod author instructed you to do that.
; Please also note that loading editor IDs of forms at runtime may increase RAM usage of a dll (approximately 5 MB).
; This also allows you to use editor IDs in console commands, e.g. "player.additem weap10mmpistol"
