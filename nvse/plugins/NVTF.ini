;This plugin now requires Windows 7 or above (sorry, XP and Vista)
;Dont enable options just because, only enable stuff if you know what you're doing



[Main]
;Fix for the dreaded 64Hz bug, it's also required for the high fps fix below
bGTCFix = 1

;Self Explanatory
bFastExit = 1

;Inline dumb obsidian functions. Can help with load times and other stuff. Check the Inline section in the ini for further options
bInlineCommonFunctions=1

;Tweaks for the game's hashtables. Helps a LOT with menu lag
bRedoHashtables=1


;This modifies vanilla DX9 behavior so textures don't get mirrored into RAM and offers D3D9X as an option. D3D9Ex is necessary for exclusive fullscreen
;it offers some extra features, too
;Massive RAM usage decrease expected
;You'll have to use windowed mode, the D3D9Ex option below or OneTweak unless you enjoy alt tab crashes.
;Disabled by default due to the potential to cause issues if the mentioned procedures aren't followed.
bModifyDirectXBehavior=1

;Experimental Hooks. They can give you a pretty nice performance boost at the cost of some stability

bEnableExperimentalHooks=1

;Forces the game to use the value in the brightness slider even in windowed mode (works well with OneTweak)
;Experimental, can cause issues after exiting the game if the game is forcefully terminated, disabled by default
bAllowBrightnessChangeWindowed=1

[GTC]
;FPS Fix. Simple as that. You don't actually need this if your fps are below 50 all the time
bFPSFix=1
;Safer, but somewhat less accurate GTC Fix, enabled by default. Disable it if you want to try squeezing even more fluidity.
;Enabled by default, if you want the more accurate one, disable.
bAlternateGTCFix=0

[FPSFix]
;Like SKSE Havok Fix
bfMaxTime=1

;Set this to your fps cap plus 60. Putting it at 0 will remove the max checks, but it will definitely have repercussions if you plan to Alt-Tab, and it's generally NOT recommended.
;If you can't stand the spider fingers bug and your max fps are 60, ignore above, set this to 59, ensure you limit your fps to 59 or 60
iMaxFPSTolerance=0
;If you know you're able to get more than 24 fps all the time, put this at your desired minimum. Otherwise, leave it. The absolute minimum would be 1. But I would strongly discourage to go below 20.
iMinFPSTolerance = 30
;lipsync fix
fDialogFixMult=2.000







[DirectX]
;You must enable this if you're using exclusive fullscreen and bModifyDirectXBehavior, otherwise your game WILL crash on alt tab
;It's recommended to enable it, anyway, most benefits below require it.
;You might find out this setting can make your performance worse, in that case, disable it and use windowed mode or a borderless mod such as OneTweak
;bModifyDirectXBehavior must be set to 1 to enjoy all the benefits of D3D9Ex
;This setting is 100 incompatible with ENB, no way around it. If you plan to use ENB for whatever reason, you'll have to disable this and use windowed mode or OneTweak unless you enjoy alt tab crashes.

bUseD3D9Ex=1

;Toggle triple buffering. Can help with vSync related fps dips.
;Disable this and FlipEx if for some reason you experience an unintended fps cap to your refresh rate AND for some reason you want to play above the refresh rate of your monitor.

bToggleTripleBuffering=1

;Makes D3D9 manage resources instead of your driver 

bD3D9ManageResources=0
;requires bToggleTripleBuffering to be enabled
;You can set the number of backbuffers from a minimum of 1 (double buffering) to a maximum of 4 (quintuple buffering?)
;default is 2 (triple buffering), it's best not to touch it, but it can safely be increased to 3 or maybe even 4 (only if you're using d3d9ex, the maximum without it is 3), though 2 is still ideal. 3 might help, though
;double buffering is bad performance wise

iNumBackBuffers=2

[D3D9Ex]


;This section is only valid if bUseD3D9Ex is enabled

;Opt in into the FlipEx swapchain mode. Better Alt Tab in fullscreen likely.
bUseFlipExSwapMode=1

;Dynamic resources are safer, yet they can carry a performance penalty. Disable this if you want some extra performance
bUseDynamicResources=1


[Inlines]
;Inlines heavy obsidian functions, should keep this enabled
bHeavyInlines=1
;Inlines even small functions
bLightInlines=1

[Hashtables]
;Resize the hashtable bucket space. Enable it if you want to get rid of PipBoy lag
bResizeHashtables=1



[Experimental]
;This is the equivalent of a very famous tweak in a similar mod to this (Renderer+0x180 suppress) (Hook Critical Section) (experimental) (if your game implodes, we don't know each other).
bRemoveRCSafeGuard=1
;Extra Critical section tweaks found to be beneficial, recommended to leave enabled
bTweakMiscCriticalSections=1
;Attempted fix for the dreaded Spider Hands bug, try it if you get said bug!
bSpiderHandsFix=0
